# Mentor-Management-System
The Mentorship Management System will facilitate the creation, management, and tracking of mentorship activities within a React Tailwind-based frontend, a Node.js backend, and Firebase for data storage. The system will manage mentor portfolios, performance tracking, daily plans, and study progress tracking for students. Mentorship tracking needs to be done in order to improve the results of the students and also to keep a track of the performance of mentors.
